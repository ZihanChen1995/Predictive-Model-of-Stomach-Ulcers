# Predictive-model-of-Stomach-Ulcer

In this project, I built a predictive model using the dataset of 6,000,000 tweets from more than 3,000 twitter users. Besides mining information from the textual data inside the tweets, I also collected the 6 kinds of customize numerical information from each users who are suffering from stomach ulcers, including their follower, following, picture number and tweets amount. After data collection and cleaning, I split our original data into numerical and textual variables. For the numerical dataset, I utilized 10 different kinds of machine learning algorithms to build the classiÔ¨Åcation model, and tried cross validation and grid search methods to tune the hyperparameters in each function. In textual data part, I encoded all the tweets using TF-IDF methods to transfer the quantify text into numerical variables, then used one of the neural network model: Multi-layer perceptrons to do the analysis. Our results not only compared the accuracy of models based on different kinds of data source, but also selected out the best algorithm with its most suitable parameters setting when predicting the stomach ulcer disease.
